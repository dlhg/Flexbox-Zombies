# Flexbox Zombies Solutions
![Flexbox Zombies Background](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/conversation/background2.jpg)
I have created this repo to store my solutions to the game [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/).

# Repo Structure
This game features multiple chapters, each consisting of multiple levels. There are four possible level types:
  1) Start/End chapter screen
  2) Dialog screen
  3) New concept screen - this is a type of challenge where the mentor introduces a new concept and either provides the solution or strongly hints at it
  4) Challenge screen - this is a type of challenge where no new concept is introduced, and the mentor either provides no hint, or a more subtle hint

In this repo, each chapter of the game is given its own folder. For the purposes of this repo, I am using the .txt extension for level types 1 and 2 and the .css extension for level types 3 and 4.
